 SENG 4640 Final Project!


Created a MERN stack web application for Music Practice Tracking that lets users log their practice sessions, set goals and collaborate with other musicians on the public forum. This project is inspired from apps such as Duolingo, to keep upcoming musicians accountable with their music practice journey.
